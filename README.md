## Features

- User authentication using JWT.
- Utilize ReduxToolkit for global state management.
- Store favorite videos in database (Mongodb atlas).

## Challenges

- Implementing JWT authenticate in backend requires a lot of logical thinking, like when token should be issued? or how to get refresh token from client side?.
- I gained a solid overall understanding of how backend server work, which surely expands and deepens my understanding of front-end development.
- I also learned a lot about the relationship between data fetching from a database and client-side state management.

## Built with

- React
- ReduxToolkit / RTKQuery
